# Arguments:
#-----------
# target=<name>                      == Mapping name for partition.
# swap=<name>                        == Mapping name for swap partition.
# source='<dev>'                     == Real device for partition.
#                                    Note: You can (and should) specify a tag like UUID
#                                    for blkid (see -t option).  This is safer than using
#                                    the full path to the device.
# key='</path/to/keyfile>[:<mode>]'  == Fullpath from / or from inside removable media.
# header='</path/to/header>'         == Full path to detached LUKS header file.
# remdev='<dev>'                     == Device that will be assigned to removable media.
# gpg_options='<opts>'               == Default are --quiet --decrypt
# options='<opts>'                   == cryptsetup, for LUKS you can only use --readonly
# loop_file='<file>'                 == Loopback file.
#                                    Note: If you omit $source, then a free loopback will
#                                    be looked up automatically.
# pre_mount='cmds'                   == commands to execute before mounting partition.
# post_mount='cmds'                  == commands to execute after mounting partition.
# wait=5                             == wait given amount of seconds for source or
#                                       detached header file appear.
#-----------
# Supported Modes
# gpg					== decrypt and pipe key into cryptsetup.
#						Note: new-line character must not be part of key.
#						Command to erase \n char: 'cat key | tr -d '\n' > cleanKey'

## swap
# Swap partitions. These should come first so that no keys make their
# way into unencrypted swap.
# If no options are given, they will default to: -c aes -h sha1 -d /dev/urandom
# If no makefs is given then mkswap will be assumed
